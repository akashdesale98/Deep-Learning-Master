## Tensorflow Basic To Adavance

### Repos Aim 

To study various research papers on RNN (sequence to sequence modelling) and improving the current mathematical models on <strong>Automatic Text Summarisation</strong>(extractive + abstractive).

* Path -
  1. Revision of Deep Learning with Tensorflow (from basic to advance)
  2. Study of Various research papers and their datasets.
  3. Applying in practice.
  
# Next Level

Coming Soon :) ....
